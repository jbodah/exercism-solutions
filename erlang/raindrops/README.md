# Raindrops

Convert a number to a string, the contents of which depend on the number's factors.

- If the number has 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
- If the number has 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
- If the number has 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
- If the number does not have 3, 5, or 7 as a factor,
  just pass the number's digits straight through.

## Examples

- 28's factors are 1, 2, 4, **7**, 14, 28.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
- 30's factors are 1, 2, **3**, **5**, 6, 10, 15, 30.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
- 34 has four factors: 1, 2, 17, and 34.
  - In raindrop-speak, this would be "34".

## Running tests

In order to run the tests, issue the following command from the exercise
directory:

For running the tests provided, `rebar3` is used as it is the official build and
dependency management tool for erlang now. Please refer to [the tracks installation
instructions](http://exercism.io/languages/erlang/installation) on how to do that.

In order to run the tests, you can issue the following command from the exercise
directory.

```bash
$ rebar3 eunit
```

### Test versioning

Each problem defines a macro `TEST_VERSION` in the test file and
verifies that the solution defines and exports a function `test_version`
returning that same value.

To make tests pass, add the following to your solution:

```erlang
-export([test_version/0]).

test_version() ->
  1.
```

The benefit of this is that reviewers can see against which test version
an iteration was written if, for example, a previously posted solution
does not solve the current problem or passes current tests.

This covers the basic information on setting up the development
environment expected by the exercises.
